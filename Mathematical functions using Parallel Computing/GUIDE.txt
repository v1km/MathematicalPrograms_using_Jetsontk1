This project is based on parallel programming.Our CPU can perform tasks serially but GPU performs tasks 
Parallely with many cores present.After performing, it has been concluded that GPU is much faster than CPU.
The evidence came in picture during the runtime of processing of codes.

REQUIREMENTS:
NVIDIA JETSON TK1 BOARD
LAPTOP OR HDMI DISPLAY
KEYBOARD
MOUSE
HDMI CABLE

GETTING STARTED:
To install board,refer this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-ma4aZyqfY
Download the NVIDIA toolkit as per OS from :
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads


PRIOR KNOWLEDGE:
C or C++ LANGUAGE.

REFERNCE:
A pdf is attached in this folder ,which can be refered for gainign knowledge.Its sourced from nvidia site itself.
Plenty of videos and refernce notes are available on Nvidia site for going through it.It also enables user to 
learn Machine Learning,AI,Computer Vision also through more diffrent platforms like MATLAB,PYTHON,etc. 


INTRO TO CUDA:
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing
on graphical processing units (GPUs). With CUDA developers are able to dramatically speed up computing
applications by harnessing the power of GPUs.In GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of
the workload runs on the CPU – which is optimized for single-threaded performance – while the compute 
intensive portion of the application runs on thousands of GPU cores in parallel.When using CUDA, 
developers program in popular languages such as C, C++,Fortran, Python and MATLAB and express parallelism 
through extensions in the form of a few basic keywords. 

AREA OF INTEREST:
STUDYING MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS AND IMPLEMENTING IN IT JETSON TK1 BOARD.(for faster processing)

Codes are performed and are also implemented on JETSON TK1 board.These codes contain operations related 
to mathematics.As we know that maths is a field used in daily life and important to get our tasks done using 
computer.This project aims on that mathemtical functions like vectors , matrix , calculus functions ,etc.
The topic of the code is given in the code itself. The aim behind these several code is to compute and compet between 
CPU and GPU as well as mathematical orders implementation.Parallel computing is the future of faster processing 
of our task accomplishments.



ALETERNATIVE:
You can also run a simulator of the above board and program your code in CUDA language by downloading necessary files
in Ubuntu.The codes can also be compiled by downloading toolkit and running it in Ubuntu.,
